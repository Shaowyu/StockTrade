# StockTrade

StockTrade is a python program meant to allow users to connect their Alpaca api trading profiles with it in order to do trading.
This is a basic program with a simple trading algorithm, however users can modify the algorithm with one of their own choosing.
This program uses the Alpaca api and OpenAI api's to enact trades and utilize OpenAI's chatGPT in order to determine whether to trade a stock.

To configure this program for the user's account, enter the user's api keys into the config.py file.
