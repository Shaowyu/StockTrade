# StockTrade

StockTrade is a python program meant to allow users to connect their Alpaca api trading profiles with it in order to do trading.
This is a basic program with a simple trading algorithm, however users can modify the algorithm with one of their own choosing.
This program uses the Alpaca api to gether information on a stock which is then used to determine if it should be traded or not.

To configure this program for the user's account, enter the user's api keys into the config.py file.

# Other Implements

This program within the handleTrades.py file and config.py have logic that can be used to implement OpenAI's ChatGPT. This logic
has been commented out as it it interferes with the program. The reason for this is because it requires the user's account to 
have credits. However it can be uncommented out to utilize it.

# Purpose

The purpose of this program was to experiment with API's and learn how to use them in a real life scenario. From here this could
potetially be added to something like an app where users can trade off of that to their accounts.

# To Run

In order to run this program, run the main.py file and enter the factors that it asks.
